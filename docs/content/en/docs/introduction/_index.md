## Introduction

Redhawk is an open source infrastructures audit and management tool.
With `redhawk`, you can easily find infrastructure resources in different output formats.

## Why redhawk

### **- Auditing cloud resources**
- If you are running resources in the cloud, it is not easily to gather all resources because resources keeps changing every day.
If there are more than one account, then this problem is way more critical in terms of security.
So, you need to gather resource list when you want to audit with one command, and `redhawk` is what you are looking for.
